			<p>Lethbridge holds many attractions with both dedicated recreational centers and annual events to check out. Many of the annual events are held in Exhibition Park, with the most notable being Whoop-Up-Days around the end of the summer season. The annual fair includes rides, carnival games, fair food and the showcase of individual business products on display. </p>
		
			<p>Sports fans will enjoy the Enmax Center on the south side of Lethbridge, where various sporting events like hockey and curling take place. Many teams around the world play in the stadium, which contains seating for up to 5 900 people, with luxury suits and lounge seating. </p>
		
			<p>Recreational fans will enjoy the Cor Van Raay YMCA in west Lethbridge. The facility includes six gymnasiums and various pools with waterslides and a wave pool, as well as a lazy river for those who prefer to enjoy the water.
