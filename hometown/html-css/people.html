			<h2>People</h2>
			<p>The citizens of Lethbridge are of a diverse age range, from college and university students to senior citizens from various cultures and groups. Lethbridge is located on Blackfoot Territory and has a prominent First Nations history behind it. </p>
		
			<p>Other members of the community are here to learn and teach, as the educational institutions of Lethbridge are one of the main draws to this peaceful city. With both a college and a university within the cityâ€™s borders, many eager students come to tell and develop their stories through these institutions. </p>
