			<h2>Geography</h2>
			<p>Lethbridge is located in southern Alberta, near the Canada-United States border and is known for its vast coulee system that borders the Old Man River. The coulees were formed thousands of years ago by a melting iceberg that eroded the land into the sight it is today. The various hills and valleys make amazing spots to walk or hike, coupled with the view of the High Level Bridge makes quite the sight to see. </p>
		
			<p>There are many parkways and paths in Lethbridge to help with the flourishing ecosystem this part of the country holds, including many deer, moose and hawks.  </p>
		
			<p>Due to its relative location to the Rocky Mountains, Lethbridge is a dry and windy city, which makes for temperate seasons with warm summers and mild winters, meaning any time of the year is great to visit the city. Just make sure to bring a coat for the colder months! </p>
