	<h3>About The Best Player in TOME</h3>
		<p>Zetto is a character from the series known as Terrain of Magical Expertise, otherwise known as TOME, created by Christopher Niosi. TOME has gone through many iterations, staring in the early 2000s on <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/" target="_blank">Newgrounds</a></p>
		<p>Zetto himself is one of the main antagonists, a consistent factor between all three versions of TOME. Head of the hackers, the most opposing force of the Dandy Alliance of heroes, and all around douchebag of a guy who tends to take his reputation as number one in the world more seriously than he should. He is known for his capability and skill compared to every other player in TOME, and will make sure you know who he is by the time he's done thrashing you.</p>
		<p>His aresnal is mostly based around his most noticable feature: his mechanical left arm. This crafty weapon can become a sword, machine gun, blaster or most devistatingly, a massive energy beam. This breaker beam takes a while to charge, but destroys anything that gets in it's way. His defenses are also well trained, making it hard to leave a mark on him.</p>

		<h2>So Which is the Best?</h2>
		<p>While it's true Zetto is my favorite fictional character at the current time, with the many variations above, which one is the best?</p>
		
		<h3>Webseries Zetto.</h3>
		<img src="images/zettoGun.png" alt="Web Zetto points his gun arm at you, because he is the best.">
		<h4>Webseries Zetto is the best Zetto you can not change my mind.</h4>
		<p>He's got the best character, the best plot twists, the best overall design (ok that's debatable because RPG Zetto looks pretty fly in the scarf but still). This version of Zetto is the best. He's got the depth. The grey morality, the relatability that makes him a GOOD antagonist and he's even a bit of an antihero by the end of the series. Bask in his awe. His cobalt blue hair that looks like it's been struck by lighting and his bangs that look like the pincers of the mighty beetle.</p>
		<p>He is the best. There is no question. No denying. The plot twist behind him makes him a million times more deep than TvTome or the RPG could ever hope to manage. This version of Zetto is the best. The rest of this page is going to be about webseries Zetto because he's a deep enough character to make a whole page on, unlike the other versions of him.</p>

		<h2>Zetto and the Other Characters</h2>
		<h3>Spoilers for the big twists ahead. Do not proceed unless you've seen the webseries in full.</h3>
		<br>
		<img src="images/zettoAndAlpha.jpg" alt="Zetto fighting with Demon Alpha">
		<h3>ALPHA</h3>
		<br>
		<img src="images/alphaS2.png" alt="A picture of Alpha from TOME">
		<p>Alpha is the main protagonist of TOME in the webseries. Alpha knows Zetto as the brash, angry and competitive person he usually comes off as... when he's on his main account. Zetto actually has a second account on TOME, one that Alpha actually has met. Without Alpha realizing so, Zetto is actually a close friend to him using his alternate account.</p>
		<p>On this alternate account, known as Kirbopher, Alpha and Zetto are usually testing their skills against each other. They meet up often, chat about life outside the game and are almost like brothers. When it is revealed that Zetto and Kirbopher are the same person, Alpha is emotionally high strung from everything else at the time and lashes out at him, as he's the nearest stressor in his vicinity to take his anger out on.</p>
		<p>Despite this, Alpha and Zetto do manage to put aside their differences for the greater good of the situation, and later down the line, reconsile their differences. It is teased in a post-series short that Alpha and Zetto have become friends again, smiling as they spar with each other and just enjoy the game for what it is.</p>
		<h3>NYLOCKE</h3>
		<br>
		<img src="images/nylocke.png" alt="A picture of Nylocke">
		<p>Nylocke! Dragon of having a bio page! ...is a roleplayer in TOME that has grown infamous for being in character all the time. Nylocke also knows Zetto for his alternate account, Kirbopher. He often refers to Kirbopher as being a squire, despite him ironically being a netking in disguise, and mispronounces his name on purpose for the sake of keeping up his character.</p>
		<p>The most notable moment of Nylocke interacting with Zetto on his main account, during the Gemini Tournamment. Being opponents in the final round, Nylocke can tell Zetto is taking the game far more seriously than he should. Zetto himself has had everything he's been working for crash in on his head at this point, and with his stress being too much for him to keep a lid on, Nylocke's attempts to get him to cheer up come off as flaunting, and they blow the vent cover off the angry Zetto's emotions.</p>
		<p>Despite receiving the brunt of the rage Zetto had been keeping in him up to this point, Nylocke still takes the time to try and get Zetto to lighten up, even throwing the final match to prove his point. Zetto won't admit it, but he respects and appreciates Nylocke and everything he does to make the mood lighter despite how dark a turn things have taken by the end of the series.</p>
		<h3>GAMECRAZED/SOFDI</h3>
		<br>
		<img src="images/gamesoftRPG.png" alt="A picture of Gamesoft from the RPG because it keeps me from having to put Gamecrazed and SOFDI in the same image">
		<p>Gamcrazed is the one Zetto confides in the most in the background. It is implied that Gamecrazed figures out that Zetto and Kirbopher are the same person in the middle of the Gemini Tournament, when he asks Kirb what he has to be upset about. He's later seen talking to GC in the background, though no audible conversation is heard. It can also be inferred that Zetto in turn knows about GC's secret identity as well.</p>
		<p>Zetto knows Gamecrazed as SOFDI by the end of the series one way or another. SOFDI herself is an AI program he helped to develope during the creation of the game. SOFDI is a sentient program created to process human emotion and thought and turn it into data, exposing her to these emotions and developing her own to the point where her avatar, Gamecrazed, cannot be told apart from any other player in the game.</p>
		<p>At the moment of truth, Zetto shoots his partner in the back to keep them from harming SOFDI, a testament to how much he cares about his friend.</p>
		<h3>Kizuna/Tigerlilly</h3>
		<br>
		<img src="images/kizuna.png" alt="A picture of Kizuna">
		<p>Kizuna is Zetto's partner throughout the series. Together, they run an organization known as D-Buggers. The goal of D-Buggers is to track down a virus in the code of TOME that is capible of hurting its players in real life. They do this through hiring hackers to dig through the code for it, access beta weaponry with data absorbing capabilities and go after Alpha once they're sure he's the one who found the virus first.</p>
		<p>Zetto has known Kizuna since the beginning of the game's development. Both Zetto and Kizuna are Netkings, otherwise known as developers in the game. They are the youngest two members of the dev team, and ran through game and bug testing respectively. An accident during development created the virus, which in turn severly injured Zetto before it was locked away in the recesses of the game's code.</p>
		<p>Despite working together for a full year to track down and destroy the virus, Kizuna's reservations against SOFDI lead her to attack the sentient program, to which Zetto responded by shooting Kizuna in the back. It is unknown if they ever spoke again after this incident.</p>
